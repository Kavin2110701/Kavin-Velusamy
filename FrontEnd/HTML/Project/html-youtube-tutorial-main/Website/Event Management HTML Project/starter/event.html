            Accurately predicting the behavior of hurricanes, typhoons, and other extreme weather events is critical for disaster response and public safety. PINN has been used to predict the path and intensity of these storms by incorporating the laws of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and other physical principles.
            PINN has been used to predict the progression of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. By incorporating physiological and anatomical constraints, the network is able to make more accurate predictions about disease progression and response to treatment.
